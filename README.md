# JS330 final project

My final project for UW's "Back-End Application Development With JavaScript" course

<!-- Grading Criteria:  Demonstrate how project requirements will be met and value will be generated. Project should be split up into tasks laid out on a timeline. -->

## Project Proposal

My app will function as a national park information site for hobbyists in Washington and Oregon, with the intention of encouraging visitation to the real world locations.  For practical, deadline purposes I will be limiting the initial scope to only those two states, but the app could be expanded in the future to include NPS sites in other states as well.

Visitors to the website will be able to quickly find a list of all the national park system locations around Washington and Oregon, in order to facilitate visiting all of them. The database will include park name, park type, location, basic contact information, visitor center hours, and a brief park description including links to the official U.S. government-run informational websites.  Ideally, I would like to also include a map of the locations and (if possible) a way to see what the current weather is at any of the locations.

Only users with an _Admin_ role will be able to create, update, or delete that master list of parks.  However, the general public will be able to create accounts in order to recieve more personalized benefits from the app.

Once logged-in, a user will be able to create/read/update/delete their own unique list of NPS sites they have personally visited.  Logged-in users will also be able to leave public comments about the national parks they have visited.   Comment fields will include experiential information such as memorable sights/descriptions of the user's visit, user-generated tips for other park visitors, etc., in addition to more measurable/quantifiable data such as which specific park had been visited, what the weather had been like, etc.  Although comment creation functionality will be limited to only logged-in users, all visitors to the website (whether logged in or not) will be able to read the visitation comments left by others.

## Fulfilling Project Requirements:
<!-- Clear and direct call-outs of how you will meet the various project requirements: -->
The app will be a React Express app using MongoDB to store database contents.  CRUD routes will exist for keeping park lists and visitor comments.  All user accounts will be authenticated to allow for relevant post, update, and delete operations. User roles will determine authorization rights.  Only accounts with an _Admin_ role will be able to create, update, or delete the single master list of parks, and only an Admin will be able to delete or update information belonging to users who have the _Visitor_ role (such as their visitation comments). Indexes and text searches will allow for fast lookup of information for everyone.  Jest unit tests will be utilized to ensure all routes function properly.
