    "description": "A memorial to the unconstitutional, forced removal and incarceration of 272 Japanese Americans from Bainbridge Island on March 30, 1942 as a result of Executive Order 9066. The memorial was built on the exact path to the Eagledale dock where residents were forced to depart to be sent to concentration camps. üïäÔ∏è ''A large Western Red Cedar that stood near the Eagledale ferry dock as Bainbridge Islanders were forced to leave their homes in 1942 ‚Äî and that still stands on the site of the Memorial ‚Äî was added to the National Registry of Historic Trees in 2003 by the American Forests organization. Only the second West Coast tree to earn this distinction, it is considered a living witness to an event that helped shape our nation.'' (quoted from BIJAEMA website) üïäÔ∏è The NPS description of this historic site can be found at: https://www.nps.gov/miin/learn/historyculture/bainbridge-island-japanese-american-exclusion-memorial.htm üïäÔ∏è Although a small government trailer exists on grounds, mail can not be delivered to it.

On either side of an eddy formed by a series of sharp bends in the Snake River, are densely grouped clusters of petroglyphs and pictographs. Known as Buffalo Eddy, the unique petroglyphs contain hundreds of distinct images that possibly date from as early as 4,500 years ago.''",
