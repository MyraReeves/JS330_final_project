The memorial was built on the exact path to the Eagledale dock where residents were forced to depart to be sent to concentration camps. üïäÔ∏è ''A large Western Red Cedar that stood near the Eagledale ferry dock as Bainbridge Islanders were forced to leave their homes in 1942 ‚Äî and that still stands on the site of the Memorial ‚Äî was added to the National Registry of Historic Trees in 2003 by the American Forests organization. Only the second West Coast tree to earn this distinction, it is considered a living witness to an event that helped shape our nation.''
